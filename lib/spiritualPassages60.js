We think that the point is to pass the test or to overcome the problem, but the truth is that things don't really get solved. They come together and they fall apart. Then they come together again and fall apart again. It's just like that. The healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen: room for grief, for relief, for misery, for joy.",

    tradition: "Tibetan Buddhism",
    reflection: "You may be waiting for the day when everything clicks into place — when you feel ready, when the anxiety lifts, when fatherhood stops feeling terrifying and starts feeling natural. That day may not come the way you imagine it. Instead, readiness comes in waves, mixed with doubt, interrupted by fear, and that is completely fine. Make room for the whole messy process. The healing is in the room you make, not in the resolution."

When his task is accomplished, the people all remark: we did it ourselves.",

One day, your child will accomplish something and say, 'I did it myself,' and they will be right. And you will be the water that made the garden possible, the ground that held the roots. This is the quiet, world-changing power of good fatherhood."

The anxious thought that arrives at midnight will pass. The surge of joy when you see the ultrasound will pass. But the depth from which they arise — that is you. Root your identity in the depth, not the disturbance. That is where your child will find you steady."

There is no room on it for the baggage of perfectionism, for the suitcases of other people's expectations, for the heavy trunk of comparison. Travel light. The bridge will hold you, but only if you stop frightening yourself with stories about falling. One foot in front of the other. The main thing — the only thing — is not to be afraid."

That small shift is the hinge on which everything turns."
